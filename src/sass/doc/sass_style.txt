                        Sass Class Styling:

Order:
-- List "extends" first
-- List "includes" second (separate by vendor and author)
-- List regular style rules last
-- Next, list nested pseudo class and pseudo elements
-- Lastly, add list nested selectors (same order rules apply within nested selectors)
-- In your global stylesheet, @import a _shame.scss file last.

Grouping: 
-- Group related style rules (one line between rule groups)
-- Two lines between class selectors
-- One rule per line
-- One selector per line, One rule per line
-- Break Into As Many Small Files As Makes Sense
-- Styles only exist in component files, not in global or section-specific sass files

Compilation/Deployment:
-- Locally, Compile with Source Maps
-- In Deployment, Compile Compressed
-- Don't Even Commit .css Files

DO:
-- Have a plan for class name naming
-- Be consistant with indentation
-- Be consistant about where spaces before/after colons/braces go
-- List Vendor/Global Dependencies First, Then Author Dependencies, Then Patterns, Then Parts
-- Be Generous With Comments

DON'T:
-- Don't use ID's (only class and element selectors)
-- Don't write vendor prefixes (use autoprefixing)
-- Don't nest more than three levels
-- Don't write a nested selector more than 50 lines
